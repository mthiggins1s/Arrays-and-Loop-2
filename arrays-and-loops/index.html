<!-- Array Syntax Rules
 - to Create an Array, we start with an open square and close with a closed bracket
 - Inside, we can put a list of values separated via comma.
 - if we want to get the value within the array, we can use square brackets and a value like 1, or the "Index", which is the position in the array. Ex. 0 would be position 1, 1 would be 2, etc. -->

 <!-- Array Methods
 - Array.isArray(value) - checks if a value is an array.
 - arr.push(value) - adds a value to the end of the array.
 - arr.pop() - removes the last value from the array and returns it.
 - arr.shift() - removes the first value from the array and returns it.
 - arr.splice() - removes a value from the array at a specific index.
